# Flocking Boids

This is a flocking boids simulation, based on the [Craig Reynolds Model](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/), built inside the Unreal Engine Application.

## The Application
To be implmented.

## The Rules

There are three core rules the boids follow.

* Cohesion : Boids Steers to stay near other boids.
- Seperation : Boids Steers to avoid collision with other boids.
* Alignment : boids Steers toward the same direction as others.
